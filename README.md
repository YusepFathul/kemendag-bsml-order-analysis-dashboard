## Project Overview  
This project is an analytical dashboard developed to monitor the Legal Metrology service operations under BSML Regional II.  
The dashboard presents real-time performance indicators such as certification completion, monthly instrument workload trends, and service coverage across Indonesian regions.

Developed as part of an internship program at the Ministry of Trade, this dashboard assists internal units in performance evaluation, workload monitoring, and decision-making.  
Visual components include KPI summaries, monthly trends, cumulative growth, and geographical distribution.  
Structured dashboard information is based on reference visualization data. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Objectives  
- Monitor certification workload and service throughput.  
- Track monthly and cumulative trends of verified instruments.  
- Visualize service coverage by city/regency.  
- Enable data-driven evaluation and operational planning.

## Dashboard Components

### 1. KPI Summary
| Metric | Certificate | Instruments |
|---|---|---|
| Total Orders | 1,881 | 8,297 |
| Completed | 1,741 | 7,434 |
| Pending | 140 | 863 |

Data highlights strong completion performance and limited backlog. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 2. Monthly Trend Analysis  
The instrument processing trend chart demonstrates workload fluctuation throughout the year.  
The highest recorded workload occurred in November 2025, reaching 929 processed instruments.

Monthly performance increases progressively into Q3 and Q4. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

---

### 3. Cumulative Growth  
Cumulative progress illustrates continuous throughput, exceeding 8,200 instrument completions by November 2025.  
The curve reflects steady and consistent operational performance. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### 4. Geographical Distribution  
A geospatial map visualizes service coverage and measurement traceability across regions:  
- 99 Cities/Regencies  
- 7 Provinces  

This component supports regional workload analysis and coverage expansion planning. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Workflow Summary
| Stage | Process Description |
|---|---|
| Data Acquisition | Collection of certification and measurement instrument records |
| Data Preparation | Cleaning, formatting, and categorizing service status |
| Dashboard Development | KPI design, trend visualization, and mapping layout |
| Insight Reporting | Summarization of performance findings and recommendations |

---

## Key Findings  
1. Completion rate achieves approximately 92%, indicating high service efficiency.  
2. Instrument volume peaks toward the end of the operational year.  
3. Service demand varies by region, presenting potential expansion areas.

---

## Recommendations  
| Recommendation | Expected Outcome |
|---|---|
| Increase operational capacity during peak cycles | Reduces backlog potential |
| Expand service coverage to low-activity regions | Improves distribution equity |
| Introduce secondary KPI measurement such as processing duration | Enhances performance diagnostics |
